This game, although it looks like it is your average game of backyard
BBQ aka Animal Crossing, is actually the evolution of a primitive religion.
Premise:
You are a fun (customizable) creature who runs through the beautiful
landscape of Persici, living a carefree existance. You encounter food
(peaches), medicine (herbs), means of creativity (charcoal pencils), 
and threats to your wellbeing (bees and thunderstorms). Throughout
your journey, you fight to stay happy and healthy and always learning.
As you encounter troubles, you have mystical interactions with a 
mythical giant llama in the sky, whom you begin to revere. <More to come>


Currently:
-Peaches for eating
-Charcoal for happiness and intelligence
-Herbs for health
-Llama tbd
